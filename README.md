# js1k
A compilation of my JS1k (JavaScript code golfing) contest entries over the years...

### JS1k 2016 - Let's get eleMental!
#### Cosmos
My first crack at a demo for JS1k. A starfield morphs into various figures before exploding back out. Spent almost as much time learning the intricasies of the Closure Compiler and RegPack as writing the actual demo.

### JS1k 2018 - Coin Mine
#### Inheritance
While mining for gold coins, you've unfortunately slipped (or were you pushed?), and you're now plummeting to your death. You're gonna die, no doubt about it... so you might as well leave your widow a sizable inheritance! Grab as many coins as you can before you go splat. Left and right arrow keys to move.

### JS1k 2018 - Coin Mine
#### Moneybugs
Moneybugs gather as the sun sets, but come dark, only the strongest stick around. Due to Unicode/Emoji differences cross platform, this demo is best on Windows 10, where the money bag has a green dollar sign $ in the center of it.

### JS1k 2019 - X
#### Sharked
Fish the rough waters with a couple of cold ones as you avoid the sharks. Hook a shark or run out of beer, and you're done. Up and down arrows to cast and reel in your line. Requires Unicode 9.0 (2016) support.
